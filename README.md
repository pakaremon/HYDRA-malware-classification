## Summary

In malware classification, grouping malicious files (in PE format) enhances the efficiency of malware analysis. Furthermore, classification helps in understanding the infection methods of computers and devices, leading to better strategies for detection and prevention.

With the large volume of malware files, manual classification requires significant resources, including human effort and time. Additionally, the ever-evolving nature of malware variants presents challenges for manual analysis. Machine learning and deep learning applications can automate the classification process, reducing human and time costs.

In this study, our team implemented deep learning models using the Microsoft Malware Classification dataset. We also collected labeled executable malware files and applied deep learning techniques for their classification.

Our results on the Microsoft Malware Classification dataset achieved an accuracy of 0.93 with the combined model (HYDRA) after experimenting with four different deep learning models. We also achieved relatively good results with our collected data.
